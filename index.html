                                <p>Our work aims to localize and detect onset of realistic falls 
                                    from video. We expanded on previous work in the research sphere using
                                    contrived datasets to detect falls in highly variable
                                    video. Detection of falls can support increased response times to prevent injury in elderly populations,
                                    individuals who suffer from seizures, those with limited mobility, and patients in the hospital.</p>

                                <h3>OptiTrip: Detecting Falls Using Optical Flow</h3>
                                <p>Fall detection is an active area of research that has
                                    major potential impact. In the US, the aging population
                                    is constantly growing. Along with this growth, the
                                    fall death rate is increasing - up 30% from 2007 to
                                    2016. Every year, over 3 million elderly people are
                                    treated in emergency departments as a result of fall
                                    injuries, and one in five falls causes severe injury, such
                                    as broken bone or head injury. Accurate detection
                                    of falls is vital to timely intervention. Current state-ofthe-art focuses on video- and sensor-based detection.
                                    Video based monitoring can provide critical support
                                    for detection of injury and falls, enabling improved
                                    response times and mitigating long term effects. We
                                    focused our project scope in fall detection using video
                                    due to the ubiquitous video monitoring in hospitals
                                    and elderly care homes where such applications can be
                                    most helpful. We aim to use optical flow and human
                                    pose tracking to localize falls from standard RGB video
                                    feed. We performed our analysis with videos from
                                    a standard falls database labeled with fall onset and
                                    termination, and our own collected data with simulated
                                    falls. While we specifically mention the impact to older
                                    populations, accurate fall detection can extend to other
                                    vulnerable populations including people affected by
                                    seizures, people with limited mobility, and patients
                                    recovering in hospital.</p>

                                <p>This project focuses on solving the dynamic ride sharing problem which was defined as the problem in which the following conditions exist: </p>
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>A random start position is known</li>
                                    <li>There are four randomly located waypoints that each need to be visited only once and in no
                                    specified order</li>
                                    <li>There is one final goal that does not change which is centralized given the positional bounds of
                                    the problem</li>
                                    <li>All dynamic constraints are known (including location of obstacles)</li>
                                    <li> The goal is to minimize the control effort (the smoothness of the ride) and keep the controlled
                                    vehicle as close to the ideal path along the route</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p> Solving the problem with 
                                    random orientations of stopping position is too complex so the states of each stops are simplified.
                                    Dijkstra’s algorithm and dynamic programming together provide a valid solution to minimize the distance
                                    between all the way points. Multiple shooting solves the minimal control effort and linear velocity
                                    between each stop. A nonlinear controller designed by feedback linearization can track the desired
                                    trajectory. Combining these three subproblems, we optimize the dynamic ride sharing problem with
                                    minimum distance and minimum control effort</p>

                                <p>This project focused on producing a gripper with comparable grasping reach to the Robotiq 3-finger gripper but that was more compact in space for more possible 
                                    variety in grasp approach for deformable objects. Several iterative prototypes were designed, manufactured, and tested. One of the prototypes were selected for 
                                    further developmenet. The hardware was iterated on and eventually moved over to being majority 3D printed. The low cost of the non-3D printed components and ease 
                                    of replacement of 3D printed components made the manipulator ideal for testing riskier planning algorithms where collision had more potential to occur or with objects 
                                    where the gripper needed to be closer to the surface the object was on. Testing of the manipulator allowed to determine and prove a reliable gripper lifecycle for the
                                  expected test demands of the lab. Force sensing using basic presure sensors at the fingertips was added to the manipulator to further mimic the capabilities of the
                                  off-the-shelf manipulator and make the gripper more robust to grasping a variety of objects.</p>

                                <p>This project focused on finding a unique approach to the desire of reducing an off-road vehicles turning radius while meeting the following demands:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>has no significant affect on the vehicle’s rear-suspension geometry</li>
                                    <li>has low rotational inertia</li>
                                    <li>does not distract the driver from steering, accelerating, and braking</li>
                                    <li>does not result in a loss of rear wheel traction</li>
                                    <li>is durable enough to last extreme driving conditions (including weather) and over 50 hours of continous driving</li>
                                    <li>does not exceed a budget of $1,000</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>To meet these demands and also have a significant impact in reducing the low-speed turning radius of the vehicle, our team selected
                                to design and prototype a design which added freewheel clutched to the single output shaft to allow for reduce frictional torque on the vehicle when
                                turning at low speed thus resulting in an increased turn radius.</p>

                                <p>Fall detection is an active area of research that has
                                    major potential impact. In the US, the aging population
                                    is constantly growing. Along with this growth, the
                                    fall death rate is increasing - up 30% from 2007 to
                                    2016. Every year, over 3 million elderly people are
                                    treated in emergency departments as a result of fall
                                    injuries, and one in five falls causes severe injury, such
                                    as broken bone or head injury. Accurate detection
                                    of falls is vital to timely intervention. Current state-ofthe-art focuses on video- and sensor-based detection.
                                    Video based monitoring can provide critical support
                                    for detection of injury and falls, enabling improved
                                    response times and mitigating long term effects. We
                                    focused our project scope in fall detection using video
                                    due to the ubiquitous video monitoring in hospitals
                                    and elderly care homes where such applications can be
                                    most helpful. We aim to use optical flow and human
                                    pose tracking to localize falls from standard RGB video
                                    feed. We performed our analysis with videos from
                                    a standard falls database labeled with fall onset and
                                    termination, and our own collected data with simulated
                                    falls. While we specifically mention the impact to older
                                    populations, accurate fall detection can extend to other
                                    vulnerable populations including people affected by
                                    seizures, people with limited mobility, and patients
                                    recovering in hospital.

                                <p>This project focuses on solving the dynamic ride sharing problem which was defined as the problem in which the following conditions exist: </p>
                                <p>1. A random start position is known</p>
                                <p>2. There are four randomly located waypoints that each need to be visited only once and in no
                                    specified order</p>
                                <p>3. There is one final goal that does not change which is centralized given the positional bounds of
                                    the problem</p>
                                <p>4. All dynamic constraints are known (including location of obstacles)</p>
                                <p>5. The goal is to minimize the control effort (the smoothness of the ride) and keep the controlled
                                    vehicle as close to the ideal path along the route</p>

                                
                                <p> Solving the problem with 
                                    random orientations of stopping position is too complex so the states of each stops are simplified.
                                    Dijkstra’s algorithm and dynamic programming together provide a valid solution to minimize the distance
                                    between all the way points. Multiple shooting solves the minimal control effort and linear velocity
                                    between each stop. A nonlinear controller designed by feedback linearization can track the desired
                                    trajectory. Combining these three subproblems, we optimize the dynamic ride sharing problem with
                                    minimum distance and minimum control effort</p>

                                <p>6. User presses mouse buttons to record the target position joint angles</p>
                                <p>7. Move ur5 robot to home configuration</p>
                                <p>8. Compute an appropriate gesture move based on which desired configuration is input as the startposition</p>
                                <p>9. Move robot to gesture position to indicate which cup the robot will be moving towards first</p>
                                <p>10. Prompt user for the control scheme requested</p>
                                <p>11. User enters value corresponding to desired control scheme</p>
                                <p>12. Control scheme specified is executed with user input home, start, and target configurations</p>

                    <p>I am interested in sustainability and like to explore ways I can reduce my impact on the environment. I have recently taken up sewing and up-cycling clothing. I also enjoy other hands-on activities including crafting and DIY projects.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I enjoy hiking and camping. I am preparing a extended backpacking trip of the Appalachian Trail this year COVID-permitting.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I also enjoy learning and understanding how other people experience life every day. I am an avid reader of memoirs and documentary watcher.</p>
